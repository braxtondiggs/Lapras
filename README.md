Classic pong clone featuring lasers and power ups. Made in [Construct 2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2).
## Game Play

- Each player is armed with a laser, which may be used to slice apart their opponent's paddle.
- Multiple balls may be on-screen at any one time. The last ball to pass by a paddle is the one that counts.
- Powerups may be acquired that either enhance a player's paddle or alter a ball's characteristics.
- Buttons: Player 1/Blue: up/down keysto move and right arrow keys to shoot laser
- Player 2/ Red: A/Z keys to move and X key to shoot laser
- For a list of all power ups click the settings button in the game
- Lastly, the game does have a couple bugs! I am working non-stop to solve them.
